- Miners in the Blockchain Insights subnet are tasked with the crucial job of transforming raw blockchain data into structured graph models. These models are not limited to simple transactions; they extend to encompass DeFi protocol transactions and NFT exchanges, providing a comprehensive view of asset flow. The funds flow graph model is a prime example of their work, offering a detailed visualization of monetary movements between various addresses or accounts. Through these models, miners enable the network to map and scrutinize the complex web of blockchain interactions.

#### PROTOCOL
- The protocol is a defined set of rules for data exchange between miners and validators in the Blockchain Insights subnet. It governs how miners serve data in response to queries from validators, APIs, or other subnets. This protocol delineates the data contract, specifying the structure and format of data to be exchanged, ensuring consistency and interoperability within the network's operations.

#### Validators
- Within the blockchain insights subnet, validators perform a crucial, multifaceted role. They act as a proxy, efficiently routing queries between miners, other subnets, and APIs. In addition to this intermediary function, validators are responsible for grouping miners. This grouping is based on the specific blockchain domains and graph model types that the miners specialize in, optimizing the subnet's query handling capabilities. Moreover, validators rank these miners, taking into account the correctness and performance of the data they provide. This ranking ensures that the subnet maintains high standards of data quality and performance, thereby upholding the overall integrity and reliability of the blockchain insights generated.

#### Subnets
- Subnets are distinct segments of the Bittensor network, each able to query and interact with the blockchain insights subnet for specific data and analytical purposes.

- The protocol within the blockchain insights subnet is a set of rules facilitating data exchange between miners and validators. It allows miners to serve data in response to queries originating from validators, APIs, or other subnets. This protocol outlines the specific data contract, which includes the structure and format of the data to be exchanged, ensuring consistency and effective communication within the network. The protocol's design is crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of data transfer in the subnet.

#### Validator
- Within the blockchain insights subnet, the role of the validator is multifaceted. Validators act as a routing layer, directing queries between the API, subnets, and miners. They are responsible for organizing miners into groups based on their area of blockchain specialization and the types of graph models they handle. Additionally, validators rank miners by the accuracy and performance of their data contributions. This ranking is key to maintaining the subnet's standard for data quality and efficiency, ensuring the reliability of the insights provided. Through these activities, validators uphold the subnet's data integrity and streamline the flow of information.

#### Miner's Registry
- The Miner's Registry is a database residing on the validator's side within the blockchain insights subnet. Its primary function is to keep track of the various miners, organizing them by the specific blockchain networks they support and the graph models they are capable of handling. This organization enables validators to efficiently manage and allocate data requests to the appropriate miners based on their specialties, ensuring that the data served is relevant and up to the validators' requirements for accuracy and performance. The Miner's Registry is a critical component in maintaining the integrity of the subnet's operations, enabling a structured and systematic approach to handling the flow of blockchain data.

#### Blockchair API
- The Blockchair API is a search and analytics engine that provides access to data across 17 blockchains, supporting complex queries for detailed analysis. It is used within the blockchain insights subnet to validate miner outputs, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

#### API
- The API in the blockchain insights subnet serves as a gateway for executing Cypher queries on the data provided by miners. Requests made through the API are routed by the validator to the appropriate miners based on their registered capabilities in the Miner's Registry. This ensures that queries are handled efficiently and by the most suitable data source. The API offers a range of predefined queries for common tasks and analytics, as well as a Cypher endpoint that allows users to execute custom queries. This dual functionality facilitates both standard and bespoke data analysis, making the API a versatile tool for accessing and interrogating the wealth of information within the subnet.

#### SUBNETS
- In the blockchain insights subnet, subnets represent interconnected segments of the broader Bittensor network. Each subnet has the capability to query the blockchain insights subnet for specific data and insights. These subnets facilitate specialized interactions and data exchanges within the network, allowing for targeted analytics and information retrieval tailored to their unique requirements.

# Writing your own subnet API
To leverage the abstract `SubnetsAPI` in Bittensor, you can implement a standardized interface. This interface is used to interact with the Bittensor network and can is used by a client to interact with the subnet through its exposed axons.

What does Bittensor communication entail? Typically two processes, (1) preparing data for transit (creating and filling `synapse`s) and (2), processing the responses received from the `axon`(s).

This protocol uses a handler registry system to associate bespoke interfaces for subnets by implementing two simple abstract functions:
- `prepare_synapse`
- `process_responses`

These can be implemented as extensions of the generic `SubnetsAPI` interface.  E.g.:


This is abstract, generic, and takes(`*args`, `**kwargs`) for flexibility. See the extremely simple base class:
```python
class SubnetsAPI(ABC):
    def __init__(self, wallet: "bt.wallet"):
        self.wallet = wallet
        self.dendrite = bt.dendrite(wallet=wallet)

    async def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return await self.query_api(*args, **kwargs)

    @abstractmethod
    def prepare_synapse(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        """
        Prepare the synapse-specific payload.
        """
        ...

    @abstractmethod
    def process_responses(self, responses: List[Union["bt.Synapse", Any]]) -> Any:
        """
        Process the responses from the network.
        """
        ...

```


Here is a toy example:

```python
from bittensor.subnets import SubnetsAPI
from MySubnet import MySynapse

class MySynapseAPI(SubnetsAPI):
    def __init__(self, wallet: "bt.wallet"):
        super().__init__(wallet)
        self.netuid = 99

    def prepare_synapse(self, prompt: str) -> MySynapse:
        # Do any preparatory work to fill the synapse
        data = do_prompt_injection(prompt)

        # Fill the synapse for transit
        synapse = StoreUser(
            messages=[data],
        )
        # Send it along
        return synapse

    def process_responses(self, responses: List[Union["bt.Synapse", Any]]) -> str:
        # Look through the responses for information required by your application
        for response in responses:
            if response.dendrite.status_code != 200:
                continue
            # potentially apply post processing
            result_data = postprocess_data_from_response(response)
        # return data to the client
        return result_data
```

You can use a subnet API to the registry by doing the following:
1. Download and install the specific repo you want
1. Import the appropriate API handler from bespoke subnets
1. Make the query given the subnet specific API


See a simplified example for subnet 21 (`FileTao` storage) below. See `examples/subnet21.py` file for a full implementation example to follow:

```python

# Subnet 21 Interface Example

class StoreUserAPI(SubnetsAPI):
    def __init__(self, wallet: "bt.wallet"):
        super().__init__(wallet)
        self.netuid = 21

    def prepare_synapse(
        self,
        data: bytes,
        encrypt=False,
        ttl=60 * 60 * 24 * 30,
        encoding="utf-8",
    ) -> StoreUser:
        data = bytes(data, encoding) if isinstance(data, str) else data
        encrypted_data, encryption_payload = (
            encrypt_data(data, self.wallet) if encrypt else (data, "{}")
        )
        expected_cid = generate_cid_string(encrypted_data)
        encoded_data = base64.b64encode(encrypted_data)

        synapse = StoreUser(
            encrypted_data=encoded_data,
            encryption_payload=encryption_payload,
            ttl=ttl,
        )

        return synapse

    def process_responses(
        self, responses: List[Union["bt.Synapse", Any]]
    ) -> str:
        for response in responses:
            if response.dendrite.status_code != 200:
                continue
            stored_cid = (
                response.data_hash.decode("utf-8")
                if isinstance(response.data_hash, bytes)
                else response.data_hash
            )
            bt.logging.debug("received data CID: {}".format(stored_cid))
            break

        return stored_cid


class RetrieveUserAPI(SubnetsAPI):
    def __init__(self, wallet: "bt.wallet"):
        super().__init__(wallet)
        self.netuid = 21

    def prepare_synapse(self, cid: str) -> RetrieveUser:
        synapse = RetrieveUser(data_hash=cid)
        return synapse

    def process_responses(self, responses: List[Union["bt.Synapse", Any]]) -> bytes:
        success = False
        decrypted_data = b""
        for response in responses:
            if response.dendrite.status_code != 200:
                continue
            decrypted_data = decrypt_data_with_private_key(
                encrypted_data,
                response.encryption_payload,
                bytes(self.wallet.coldkey.private_key.hex(), "utf-8"),
            )
        return data

 
Example usage of the `FileTao` interface, which can serve as an example for other subnets.

cid = await StoreUserAPI(
      axons=query_axons, # the axons you wish to query
      # Below: Parameters passed to `prepare_synapse` for this API subclass
      data=b"Hello Bittensor!",
      encrypt=False,
      ttl=60 * 60 * 24 * 30, 
      encoding="utf-8",
      uid=None,
